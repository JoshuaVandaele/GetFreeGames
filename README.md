I don't have the ressources to keep this up to date, I recommend you check out https://github.com/Luois45/claim-free-steam-packages if you want to claim free games as they appear, or https://github.com/Luois45/claim-free-steam-packages if you want to claim ALL of Steam's games!

# GetFreeGames
This script requires "ArchiSteamFarm", and the pip package `requests`  
This is meant to run 24/7, and will take at *least* half a week to go through all the steam games, as to respect Steam's API ratelimit.

/!\ This is a standalone script using ASF's IPC API, not a DLL or plugin!
